      "1. **Narrow AI**: Designed for specific tasks (e.g., voice assistants, recommendation algorithms).\n",
      "2. **General AI**: Theoretical, mimics human reasoning across diverse tasks (not yet achieved).\n",

      "\n",
      "### **Applications**\n",
      "- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases, drug discovery.\n",
      "- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading.\n",
      "- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles.\n",
      "- **Entertainment**: Personalized content recommendations.\n",

      "\n",
      "### **1. Core Concepts**\n",
      "- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data without explicit programming. Examples include recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix) and spam filters.\n",
      "- **Neural Networks:** Inspired by the human brain, these are layered algorithms that process data to recognize patterns (e.g., image or speech recognition).\n",
      "- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables machines to understand and generate human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools).\n",

      "### **2. Types of AI**\n",
      "- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Designed for specific tasks (e.g., virtual assistants like Siri, self-driving cars).\n",
      "- **General AI (Strong AI):** Theoretical, mimicking human cognitive abilities across diverse tasks. Not yet achieved.\n",
      "- **Superintelligent AI:** Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence (speculative and not currently possible).\n",

      "- **Entertainment:** Content recommendation, generative art/ music.\n",

      "---\n",

      "### **4. Ethical Considerations**\n",
      "- **Bias:** AI systems may inherit biases from training data (e.g., racial or gender discrimination in hiring tools).\n",
      "- **Privacy:** Data collection for AI training raises concerns about surveillance and data misuse.\n",
      "- **Job Displacement:** Automation may impact employment in certain sectors.\n",

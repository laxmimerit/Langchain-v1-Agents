      "3. **Computer Vision**: Allows systems to interpret and analyze visual data (e.g., facial recognition, self-driving cars).\n",

      "Wait, I should also cover the different types of AI. There's narrow AI, which is what we use today for specific tasks, and general AI, which is more theoretical. Maybe mention some applications they might know, like virtual assistants or recommendation systems. Oh, and include some key concepts like machine learning and neural networks. But I need to explain these in simple terms without getting too technical.\n",

      "I should also touch on the history a bit, like when AI started and some milestones. But keep it concise. The user might be looking for a basic overview, so I shouldn't dive too deep. Let me structure this in a way that's easy to follow: definition, types, key concepts, applications, and maybe a note on ethical considerations. Make sure to offer further help in case they have more specific questions. Let me check if I need to use any functions here.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT WITH PYDANTIC MODELS

Instead of getting free-form text responses, you can force the agent to
return data in a specific structure using Pydantic models.

Benefits:
- Guaranteed data format for downstream processing
- Type validation and error checking
- Easy integration with databases, APIs
- Consistent output regardless of model variations

How It Works:
1. Define a Pydantic model with required fields
2. Pass it as response_format to create_agent()
3. Agent output includes both regular text AND structured data

Use Cases:
- Data extraction from text
- Form filling applications
- API responses that need specific formats
- Database record creation

Note: The agent will try to extract structured data from its reasoning,
but the regular conversation flow still works normally.

Prerequisites:
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-core langgraph pydantic
ollama pull qwen3
ollama serve

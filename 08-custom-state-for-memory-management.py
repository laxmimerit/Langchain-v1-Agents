CUSTOM AGENT STATE FOR MEMORY MANAGEMENT

By default, agents only remember the conversation messages. But you can
create custom state schemas to track additional information:

Default AgentState:
- Only tracks messages[]

Custom AgentState:
- Messages (conversation history)
- User preferences (personalization data)
- Session data (temporary info for current session)
- Task history (what the user has done before)

Benefits of Custom State:
- Persistent user preferences across conversations
- Context-aware responses based on history
- Session management for complex workflows
- Better personalization and user experience

State Persistence:
- Within conversation: Automatic
- Between conversations: Requires external storage
- Cross-session: Needs database/file storage

Use Cases:
- Customer service (remember user's problem history)
- Educational tutors (track learning progress)
- Personal assistants (remember preferences)

Prerequisites:
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-core langgraph pydantic

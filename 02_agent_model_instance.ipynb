    "## Model Parameters Explained\n",

      "Okay, let me check the user's question again. They asked, \"What's 15 * 27 + 100?\" So first, I need to calculate 15 multiplied by 27. Let me do that step by step. 15 times 20 is 300, and 15 times 7 is 105. Adding those together gives 300 + 105 = 405. Then, adding 100 to that result: 405 + 100 = 505. Wait, but maybe I should verify using another method. Let's break down 27 into 25 + 2. 15*25 is 375, and 15*2 is 30. Adding those gives 375 + 30 = 405. Then adding 100 still gives 505. Both methods lead to the same answer. I'll use the calculate function to confirm the result once more. The expression \"15 * 27 + 100\" should evaluate to 505. Alright, that's consistent. The final answer is 505.\n",

      "Okay, the user is asking what 2 + 2 equals and wants me to show my reasoning. Let me start by recalling basic arithmetic. Addition is one of the fundamental operations. When you add 2 and 2, you're combining two groups of one item each. Wait, no, actually, each number represents a quantity. So 2 is two units, adding another two units would total four. Let me verify that. If I have two apples and add two more, I have four apples. That seems right. But maybe I should check using a different method. Let's count: 1, 2 (that's the first 2), then 3, 4 (adding the second 2). Yep, that's four. Alternatively, using a number line: starting at 2 and moving 2 steps forward lands me at 4. All these methods confirm the result is 4. I should also mention that this is a basic arithmetic fact, so there's no need for complex calculations here. The answer should be straightforward.\n",

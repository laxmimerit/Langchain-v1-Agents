      "\n",
      "Next, there's a YouTube playlist. The user might prefer video tutorials, so including that makes sense. But the URL is a bit long, maybe just mention it's a playlist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reddit's r/Python community is listed. It's a community for news and discussions, not exactly tutorials, but still useful for getting help or finding resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hackertab has hourly updates on Python news and tutorials. Maybe the user wants the latest content, so that's a good resource.\n",

      "I should summarize these results clearly. Let me check if all the links are relevant. The YouTube link seems to be a playlist, so I'll note that. The Medium article is about projects, which is a different angle than standard tutorials. The Reddit and Hackertab are communities/news, so maybe mention they offer additional resources beyond tutorials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user specifically asked for tutorials, so maybe focus on the ones that are actual tutorials. The Plain English site and the YouTube playlist are direct tutorials. The Medium article is more project-based, which is a bit different but still helpful. The others are communities, so maybe mention them as supplementary.\n",

      "Wait, the user just asked for tutorials, so maybe the Medium article is more about projects than tutorials. But the title says \"Beginner-Friendly Python Projects,\" which might be a type of tutorial. I'll include it but clarify it's project-based.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, check if the results are recent. The Plain English mentions \"17 hours ago,\" Hackertab says \"9 hours ago,\" so they're up-to-date. The YouTube playlist might be older, but it's a curated list.\n",
